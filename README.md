# Poke

A browser folklore RPG: explore isometric zones, befriend creatures, spar for materials, craft at Moon Shrine, then invite friends into your world.

## How to play

### Controls

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Arrow keys** or **WASD** | Move (hold to keep walking) |
| **E** | Interact — open Moon Shrine when standing on the moon altar |
| **I** | Copy a friend invite link (host only) |
| **Reset game** (status panel) | Wipe local host save and start fresh |

### Confined region

Start in **Whisper Grove**, then walk map exits through **Moon Shrine** to **Hearth Crossing**. North of the village are **Folklore Fields**, connected **Mistwood Reach**, and **Emberfen Hollow**, locked until Story quest 2 is complete.

### Story quests

The HUD shows `Story N/4: …` and a short “Next” hint. Host progress saves automatically.

1. **Befriend a wild creature** — walk until an encounter appears, then choose **Befriend**.
2. **Win a training spar** — choose **Spar** and win. This **opens the overworld gate**.
3. **Reach Hearth Crossing** — follow the path Grove → Shrine → Village.
4. **Craft a relic at Moon Shrine** — stand on the moon altar, press **E**, craft any relic.

Gate status reads `Overworld gate: LOCKED (Story 2/4)` until the spar quest is done, then `OPEN`.

### Encounters and crafting

- Walk in zones to trigger encounters: **Befriend**, **Spar**, or **Flee**.
- Winning spars grants creature materials, Folklore Dust, and XP.
- At Moon Shrine, craft relics and apply shrine effects to party creatures.

### Friend invites

1. As **host**, press **I** to copy an invite URL (party, inventory, quests, and position).
2. Open the link in another browser/tab to join as a **visitor**.
3. Visitors can explore the host snapshot but **cannot** trigger encounters, craft, or advance quests.
4. Broken or tampered `?join=` links show an error screen and do not change your local save.

### Save and resume

Host progress (party, inventory, quests, position, gate) lives in `localStorage`. Append `?new=1` or use **Reset game** to start over. A valid `?join=` invite always takes precedence over the local save.

## Development

**Requirements:** Node.js 20+ and npm.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm test         # Vitest unit tests
npm run build    # production build → dist/
npm run preview  # serve dist locally
```

Pull requests to `main` run CI (`npm ci`, `npm test`, `npm run build`). Merges deploy via Vercel.

### Dev-only cheats

These are for local development only; they are not part of normal play:

- **U** — toggle the overworld gate without completing Story 2
- `?encounter=<creatureId>` / `?spar=<creatureId>` — launch a preview encounter/spar in the Vite dev server

### Project layout

- `src/game/` — Phaser bootstrap and scenes
- `src/game/story/` — quest definitions and progress
- `src/game/world/` — zones, collision, invites, saves
- `src/game/creatures/` — catalog and party
- `src/game/inventory/` / `src/game/crafting/` / `src/game/shrine/` — materials and Moon Shrine
- `AGENTS.md` — agent workflow conventions
